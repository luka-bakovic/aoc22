### Advent of Code 2022

Looking for some mediocre solutions to the Advent of Code? Look no further!

Highlights include:

  - little to no comments
  - magic numbers
  - global variables
  - relative paths which only work in my IDE
  - the same loop copy pasted eight times and slightly modified
  
All of the code is made according to the **hey, at least it works**â„¢ philosophy.
